**Important Note**: This learning method is not for those who want to quickly dive into IT. Itâ€™s for those who want to become true system programmersâ€”individuals who can sit on Linux, code in Vim, and are unconcerned with anything else because they know the fundamentals thoroughly. Only after mastering these basics, youâ€™ll be ready to choose a specialization and focus on it.

## ðŸ“š 1. **Complete [Andrey Stolyarov's Books](http://stolyarov.info/books/programming_intro/dmk) (Foundational Phase)**

Before focusing on specific technologies or niches, you need to master the core principles of programming. Stolyarovâ€™s books will provide the foundational knowledge you need. Here's the recommended order:

### Learning Path in Stolyarov's Books:
- **Pascal**: Start with Pascal because it teaches the core concepts of structured programming, which form the foundation of algorithmic thinking.
   - **Why start with Pascal**: As Stolyarov mentions, "Pascalâ€™s simplicity and clarity help to understand the most important principles of programming without unnecessary complexity. Itâ€™s a perfect introduction to programming logic."
   - **Recommended English Alternatives**: 
     - *"Programming in Pascal" by Nell Dale* 
     - *"Pascal Programming" by Peter G. Neumark*

- **Assembly**: Once you understand programming logic, dive into Assembly to understand the internal workings of processors and memory.
   - **Why Assembly**: "Assembly gives you an insight into how computers really work and teaches you the importance of optimizing at the hardware level."
   - **Recommended English Alternatives**:
     - *"[Programming from the Ground Up](https://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf)" by Jonathan Bartlett*
     - *"The Art of Assembly Language" by Randall Hyde*

- **C**: After Assembly, move to C. It will teach you procedural programming, direct memory manipulation, and give you an understanding of systems programming.
   - **Why C**: "C is where you begin to interact directly with the operating system and the hardware. Itâ€™s the bedrock of system-level programming."
   - **Recommended English Alternatives**:
     - *"The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie*
     - *"Programming in C" by Stephen G. Kochan*

- **C++**: After reading through C, it is recommended that one advances to C++ for object oriented programming and other advanced concepts in system design.
   - **Why C++**: "C++ is an extension of C that adds object-oriented features, enabling the creation of larger, robust, and efficient software systems."
   - **Recommended English Alternatives**:
     - *"The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup*
     - *"C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman*

### ðŸ“Š **Advanced Topics to Cover**:
- **Concurrency & Multithreading**: Get to know the concepts of parallelism and synchronization.
- **System Architecture**: Expand your knowledge about the structure of a system and its subsystems.
- **Low-level Optimization**: Improve code to make it run faster and more effectively.

---

### Additional Learning Resources (English Speakers):
- **"The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald E. Knuth**
- **"[Modern Operating Systems](https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Modern%20Operating%20Systems.pdf)" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum**
- **"Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava**
- **"[Mathematics for Computer Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring18/mcs.pdf)" by Eric Lehman, F Thomson Leighton, and Albert R Meyer**
- **"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred Aho**

## ðŸŒ± 3. **Choose Your Niche (Final Phase)**

It is time to choose your niche after you have mastered all the core technologies. The appropriate niche will align with what you love doing and your expected outcome in the future. You can choose from a variety of domains in systems programming:

### Possible Specializations:
- **Banking & Finance**: High-performance systems and security protocols.
- **Cybersecurity**: Penetration Testing and Security Auditing.
- **Cloud Computing**: Work with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- **Game Development**: Specialize in game engines and low-level graphics programming.
- **Embedded Systems**: Work on IoT and real-time operating systems.
- **Blockchain**: Work on decentralized applications and smart contracts.
- **Web Development**: Full-stack development with Node.js, React, and backend frameworks.
- **Big Data**: Handle large datasets and distributed systems.
- **Systems Programming**: Low-level programming, operating systems, and network programming.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and intelligent systems development.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ 4. **Deepen Your Knowledge in the Chosen Niche**

After selecting your specialization, it's time to delve deeper into that field. Master the relevant libraries, frameworks, and tools required for the niche. This is where your specialization will shine.

- **Languages**: Learn any additional languages or frameworks specific to your niche (e.g., Go for Cloud, Solidity for Blockchain).
- **Open-source Projects**: Contribute to projects within your chosen field.
- **Certifications and Advanced Courses**: Enroll in specialized courses and earn certifications to demonstrate expertise. (P.S, Yes, what a pity that in Europe, Turkey, and other countries, they sometimes ask for certificates.)

## ðŸš€ Conclusion

This roadmap will teach you a valuable portion of programming, system-level development, and other technologies that form the foundation of a well-rounded engineer. First, learn the basics with Stolyarov's books, then build on top of that with the essential tools and frameworks. Once you have good core skills, find a niche and master it.

But the key to competent engineering lies in applying principles in real life through practice, not theoretical learning. For every phase, there must be a focus on real projects rather than concepts. Real projects might be self-building, open-source volunteering at sites such as GitHub, or teamwork solutions solving real-world problems. The more you apply, the better your solid foundation becomes.

The goal is not just to secure a job but to be ready for a career that demands real engineering skills. Continue developing yourself as an engineer throughout your career.
